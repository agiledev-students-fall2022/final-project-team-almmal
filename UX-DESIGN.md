**2. News**

The News Page is the section of the application where current investment related news briefs are displayed with sentiment score. It is designed to help the user understand market dynamics and sentiment. We can filter between different sources to see how the reaction is on differnt sources. We will perform some sentiment analysis on the data that we collect. Then, the user can see an aggregate score for the news sources that they filter.

**5. Profile**


The profile page is the section where the user can view their profile and edit it. There are options for the user to edit their username, password, and see some user statistics like the total amount invested yet. Users can decide to hide their investments or their whole profile so others can't see it.
